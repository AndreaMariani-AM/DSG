## Refresher of complex numbers

- From number line to complex number plane. Number line is the old line with Â± infinity "centered"at 0. But in maths most of the times it's better to think in planes (like real numbers axis and imaginary numbers axis).

- Basis of real axis is $\large 1$ and basis of imaginary axis is the imaginary operator $\large i = \sqrt{-1}$. FYI, i comes from the solution of the equation $$\Large x^2 +1 = 0$$ where $\large x$ needs to be equal to $\large i$

- Complex plane (maginary) can pack a lot of information into a single number. For example the number $$[\Large 2 \space 3i]$$ looks like a pair of numbers but in reality it's just one that has a `real component` $\large 2$ and and `imaginary component` $\large 3i$
