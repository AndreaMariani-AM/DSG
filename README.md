# Collection of notes for Udemy course on Digital Signal Processing (DSG)

This repo contains exercises from the [Udemy course on Signal Processing](https://www.udemy.com/course/signal-processing/?couponCode=JUST4U02223). Courses files aren't synched and can be found [here](https://github.com/mikexcohen/SignalProcessing/tree/main).

Signal processing =  decision-making + tools

Tools are mostly generic, decisions are specific
Some tools:
- Temporal Filters
- Convolution
- Wavelets transforms
- Spectral analysis (FFT) --> frequency and time frequency
- Cleaning/Denoising
- Resampling (up and downsampling)
- Interpolation and extrapolation
- Feature detection
- SNR/RMS


## TO DO

Once the course is done, here's the what i'll do:
1) Read some papers to get a feeling of the field, read [Regalia 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920121118305849?via%3Dihub), [Onorati 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.13899), [Poh 2012](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0b013e318258f7f1?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#appendix), [Poh 2012_2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03444.x), [pyPPG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11003363/), [Siirtola 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472084/), [Campanella 2023](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/7/3565)
2) use this [dataset](https://ubi29.informatik.uni-siegen.de/usi/data_wesad.html) to have a feeling of what the data looks like.
3) See if i can get up and running a ML classifier
