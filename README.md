Signal processing =  decision-making + tools

Tools are mostly generic, decisions are specific
Some tools:
- Temporal Filters
- Convolution
- Wavelets transforms
- Spectral analysis (FFT) --> frequency and time frequency
- Cleaning/Denoising
- Resampling (up and downsampling)
- Interpolation and extrapolation
- Feature detection
- SNR/RMS
